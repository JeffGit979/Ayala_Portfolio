**Credentials** – Name: Jeffrey Ayala | Graduation year: 2025 |  Major: Computer Science 
  
**Introduction** – My goal is to contribute to society by sharing my creative work, and I aspire to become a skilled and experienced software engineer. 
  
**Course List:**
  
- **Accounting II:** Fundamental principles of accounting for business entities; the reporting of financial information to users; basic considerations underlying financial and cost accounting data from a management point of view.
  
- **Data Science & AI Principles:** Students develop a critical comprehension of the fundamental principles of data science that guide the extraction of valuable information and knowledge from data. Students apply these concepts across the data science and analytics landscape within the contexts of business examples and other emerging fields. Students explore the most common methods used in data science, addressing topics such as predictive modeling, data visualization, probability distributions, Bayes' theorem, statistical inference, clustering analysis, decision analytic thinking, data and business strategy, cloud storage and big data analytics.

- **Project Management:** The course introduces traditional methods in project management, including project integration, project scope management, project time and cost management, and quality management, as well as the latest agile practices. Content is consistent with the PMBOK® Guide as well as other PMI standards and agile guides. Students prepare for the PMP® certification exam and learn to use Microsoft® Project to automate processes. The course prepares students to become Certified Associates in Project Management (CAPM®) or Certified Project Management Professionals (PMP®), if desired. Case studies, simulations, and software development projects are used throughout.
  
- **C# Programming for Web Apps:** The design and construction of Web-based applications using the C# programming language. Students will learn how to build, manage, and deploy a database driven Web site.
  
- **Comp Arch & Operating Systems:** This course covers computer architecture and operating systems. From a computer architecture standpoint, we will study hardware components, gates/buses/memory, and their use in constructing adders, comparators and addressing schemes. We will also cover machine level representation of data, computer architecture and organization, assembly level machine organization, interfacing and communication, memory systems organization and architecture, functional organization, multiprocessing and alternative architectures, performance enhancements, and distributed architectures. From an operating systems standpoint, we will study privileged and non-privileged states, processes and threads (and their management), memory (real, virtual, and management), files systems, access controls (models and mechanisms), access control lists, virtualization/hypervisors, how does an OS protect itself from attack?, security design principles as applied to an OS, domain separation, process isolation, resource encapsulation, and least privilege.
  
- **Elementary Statistics I:** Descriptive statistics, laws of probability, some standard probability functions, central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing.
