**Course List:**
  
- **Accounting II:** This course covers the fundamental principles of accounting for business entities and how financial information is recorded and reported. It explains how financial statements are prepared and used by internal and external users to make informed decisions. The course also examines key financial and cost accounting concepts from a management perspective, with an emphasis on planning, control, and decision-making.

  
- **Data Science & AI Principles:** Students develop a critical understanding of the fundamental principles of data science that guide the extraction of meaningful information and knowledge from data. These principles are applied across the data science and analytics landscape using business examples and emerging fields. The course explores common data science methods, including predictive modeling, data visualization, probability distributions, Bayesian reasoning, statistical inference, clustering analysis, decision analytics, and big data concepts.


- **Project Management:** This course introduces traditional project management methods, including integration, scope, time, cost, and quality management, along with modern agile practices. The content aligns with the PMBOK® Guide, PMI standards, and agile frameworks, and includes hands-on use of Microsoft® Project to support project planning and automation. Through case studies, simulations, and applied projects, students prepare for CAPM® or PMP® certification and develop practical project management skills.
  
- **C# Programming for Web Apps:** This course focuses on the design and development of web-based applications using the C# programming language. Students learn how to build, manage, and deploy database-driven websites. Emphasis is placed on practical development skills and real-world web application deployment.
  
- **Comp Arch & Operating Systems:** This course examines the fundamentals of computer architecture and operating systems. From the architecture perspective, students study hardware components, data representation, memory systems, assembly-level organization, performance optimization, multiprocessing, and distributed architectures. From the operating systems perspective, the course covers processes and threads, memory and file systems, access control, virtualization, and core security principles such as isolation, least privilege, and system protection.
  
- **Elementary Statistics I:** This course covers descriptive statistics and the fundamental laws of probability. It introduces standard probability distributions and the central limit theorem as the foundation for statistical inference. Students also learn to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing.
